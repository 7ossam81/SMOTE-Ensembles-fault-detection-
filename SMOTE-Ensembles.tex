\section{Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE)}

SMOTE is an oversampling technique what was first proposed in \cite{chawla2002smote}. This oversampling technique modifies the class distribution in the dataset by oversampling the minority class by creating synthetic samples rather than oversampling with replacement. Synthetic samples are generated by operating in feature space.
The minority class is oversampled by taking out each sample and creating synthetic samples along the line segments that join any/all of the $k$ minority class nearest neighbours. 

The algorithm starts by choosing $k$ nearest neighbors then synthetic samples
are generated by taking the difference between the feature vector of the sample
under consideration and its nearest neighbor. Then it Multiplies the difference by a random number between 0 and 1, and add it to the feature vector under consideration. Therefore, a random point is selected along the line segment between two specific features. Consequently, SMOTE broadens the data region of the minority class examples and forces the decision region of the lass to become more general.



\section{Datasets Description}
\label{data}




\section{Model evaluation}
\label{evaluation_criteria}
In order to evalute the performance of the software faults prediction model, we used the confusion matrix that shown in Figure \ref{fig:confusion}, which is a table that is often used to describe the classfication model results. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\label{fig:ss}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{confusion-matrix.eps}
\caption{Confusion matrix}
\end{center}
\label{fig:confusion}
\end{figure}

The bug detection effectiveness is evaluated using four measurements based on the previous confusion matrix; namely, Model Accuracy (Acc), Number of Predicted Defects (PD), Numebr of Incorectly Predicted cases with No Defects (PF), G-mean. Acc is the ratio of the correctly predicted faults to the total number of faults. PD is
the ratio of correctly predicted faults to the total number of faults. PF is the number of not fault-prone modules that are predicted incorrectly as defectes. In addtion, we used the G-mean to combine the PD and PF which is a good indicator of the relationship between the two measures. The PD, PF, G-mean are calculated in Equations \ref{accuracy}, \ref{PD}, \ref{PF}, and \ref{gmean}, respectively.

\begin{equation}
Accuracy=\frac{TP+TN}{TP + FN + FP + TN}
\label{accuracy}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
PD=\frac{TP}{TP+FN}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
PF=\frac{FP}{FP+TN}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
G-mean=\sqrt{PD \times (1-PF)}
\end{equation}
